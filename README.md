# T-rEx
Toolbox for Transcription factor exploration

This is a Shiny web application called T-rex, that lets the user visualize the binding of a transcription factor in multiple conditions overlaid with other transcription factors, explore its targets, motifs and the binding profile. The tool also allows for some statistical analysis based upon GO-terms such as Fishers exact test for TF correlation, TF binding heatmaps, network plots, linear gene expression modelling and PAM clustering.
